Equality
To check if two Python values, or variables, are equal you can use ==. 
To check for inequality, you need !=. As a refresher, have a look at the following examples that all result in True. 
Feel free to try them out in the IPython Shell.
2 == (1 + 1)
"intermediate" != "python"
True != False
"Python" != "python"
When you write these comparisons in a script, you will need to wrap a print() function around them to see the output.

Greater and less than
In the video, Filip also talked about the less than and greater than signs, < and > in Python. 
You can combine them with an equals sign: <= and >=. Pay attention: <= is valid syntax, but =< is not.
All Python expressions in the following code chunk evaluate to True:

3 < 4
3 <= 4
"alpha" <= "beta"
Remember that for string comparison, Python determines the relationship based on alphabetical order.


Compare arrays
Out of the box, you can also use comparison operators with Numpy arrays.

Remember areas, the list of area measurements for different rooms in your house from the previous course? 
This time there's two Numpy arrays: my_house and your_house. 
They both contain the areas for the kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom in the same order, so you can compare them.
