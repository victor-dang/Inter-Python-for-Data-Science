Equality
To check if two Python values, or variables, are equal you can use ==. 
To check for inequality, you need !=. As a refresher, have a look at the following examples that all result in True. 
Feel free to try them out in the IPython Shell.
2 == (1 + 1)
"intermediate" != "python"
True != False
"Python" != "python"
When you write these comparisons in a script, you will need to wrap a print() function around them to see the output.

Greater and less than
In the video, Filip also talked about the less than and greater than signs, < and > in Python. 
You can combine them with an equals sign: <= and >=. Pay attention: <= is valid syntax, but =< is not.
All Python expressions in the following code chunk evaluate to True:

3 < 4
3 <= 4
"alpha" <= "beta"
Remember that for string comparison, Python determines the relationship based on alphabetical order.
