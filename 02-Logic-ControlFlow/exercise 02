Equality
To check if two Python values, or variables, are equal you can use ==. 
To check for inequality, you need !=. As a refresher, have a look at the following examples that all result in True. 
Feel free to try them out in the IPython Shell.
2 == (1 + 1)
"intermediate" != "python"
True != False
"Python" != "python"
When you write these comparisons in a script, you will need to wrap a print() function around them to see the output.
